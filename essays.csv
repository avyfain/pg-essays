Two Kinds of Judgement,http://paulgraham.com/judgement.html,April 2007,failed
Microsoft is Dead,http://paulgraham.com/microsoft.html,April 2007,"OS X, Apple has come back from the dead in a way that is extremely rare in technology. [2] Their victory is so complete that I'm now surprised when I come across a computer running Windows.  Nearly all the people we fund at Y Combinator use Apple laptops.  It was the same in the audience at  startup school.  All the computer people use Macs or Linux now.  Windows is for grandmas, like Macs used to be in the 90s.  So not only does the desktop no longer matter, no one who cares about computers uses Microsoft's anyway.  And of course Apple has Microsoft on the run in music too, with TV and phones on the way.  I'm glad Microsoft is dead.  They were like Nero or  Commodus—evil in the way only inherited power can make you.  Because remember, the Microsoft monopoly didn't begin with Microsoft.  They got it from IBM.  The software business was overhung by a monopoly from about the mid-1950s to about 2005.  For practically its whole existence, that is.  One of the reasons ""Web 2.0"" has such an air of euphoria about it is the feeling, conscious or not, that this era of monopoly may finally be over.  Of course, as a hacker I can't help thinking about how something broken could be fixed.  Is there some way Microsoft could come back? In principle, yes.  To see how, envision two things: (a) the amount of cash Microsoft now has on hand, and (b) Larry and Sergey making the rounds of all the search engines ten years ago trying to sell the idea for Google for a million dollars, and being turned down by everyone.  The surprising fact is, brilliant hackers—dangerously brilliant hackers—can be had very cheaply, by the standards of a company as rich as Microsoft.  They can't  hire smart people anymore, but they could buy as many as they wanted for only an order of magnitude  more. So if they wanted to be a contender again, this is how they could do it:  Buy all the good ""Web 2.0"" startups.  They could get substantially     all of them for less than they'd have to pay for Facebook.   Put them all in a building in Silicon Valley, surrounded by     lead shielding to protect them from any contact with Redmond.  I feel safe suggesting this, because they'd never do it.  Microsoft's biggest weakness is that they still don't realize how much they suck.  They still think they can write software in house.  Maybe they can, by the standards of the desktop world.  But that world ended a few years ago.  I already know what the reaction to this essay will be.  Half the readers will say that Microsoft is still an enormously profitable company, and that I should be more careful about drawing conclusions based on what a few people think in our insular little ""Web 2.0"" bubble.  The other half, the younger half, will complain that this is old news.      See also:Microsoft is Dead: the Cliffs NotesNotes  [1] It doesn't take a conscious effort to make software incompatible. All you have to do is not work too hard at fixing bugs—which, if you're a big company, you produce in copious quantities.  The situation is analogous to the writing of ""literary theorists.""  Most don't try to be obscure; they just don't make an effort to be clear.  It wouldn't pay.  [2] In part because Steve Jobs got pushed out by John Sculley in a way that's rare among technology companies.  If Apple's board hadn't made that blunder, they wouldn't have had to bounce back.
